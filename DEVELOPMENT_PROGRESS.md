- Matter management system fully operational 
- API endpoints tested and functional

### Sprint 1: Core Architecture & Matter Management (Completed 2025-08-14, 3.5h)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created comprehensive Pydantic data models for all core entities
- Implemented full Matter lifecycle management (create, list, switch, delete)
- Built thread-safe Matter switching with proper isolation guarantees
- Created complete filesystem structure with all required subdirectories
- Added robust slug generation with duplicate name handling
- Implemented per-matter configuration persistence in JSON format
- Built FastAPI endpoints for all Matter operations
- Created HTTP client with proper error handling and async support
- Added comprehensive validation and error handling throughout

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Used Pydantic v2 field validators for robust data validation
- Implemented thread-safe matter switching using threading.Lock
- Chose UUID4 for matter IDs to ensure global uniqueness
- Built slug generation that handles special characters and conflicts
- Created complete directory structure upfront for better reliability
- Used separate configuration files per matter for better isolation
- Implemented proper model serialization for API compatibility

**Files Created:**
- `app/models.py` - Complete Pydantic data models with validation
- `tests/unit/test_matters.py` - Comprehensive unit test suite
- `test_sprint1.py` - Functional verification script

**Files Updated:**
- `app/matters.py` - Complete Matter management implementation
- `app/api.py` - Added Matter management API endpoints
- `ui/api_client.py` - Added Matter operation HTTP client methods

**Key Implementation Features:**
- **Matter Creation:** Validates names, generates unique slugs, creates filesystem
- **Matter Listing:** Loads from filesystem with error recovery for invalid configs  
- **Matter Switching:** Thread-safe context switching with proper isolation
- **Filesystem Management:** Creates complete directory structure per specification
- **Configuration:** JSON-based per-matter config with global TOML settings
- **API Integration:** RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- **Validation:** Comprehensive input validation with user-friendly errors

**Testing Results:**
- All core functionality verified through functional test suite
- Matter creation, listing, switching working correctly
- Filesystem structure created properly with all required directories
- Duplicate name handling generates unique slugs (name, name-1, name-2, etc.)
- Configuration persistence working for both global and per-matter settings
- Thread safety verified for concurrent matter switching operations
- Input validation properly rejects invalid data with clear error messages

**Issues Encountered:**
- Pydantic v1/v2 compatibility - migrated all validators to v2 field_validator syntax
- Settings mocking challenges in tests - resolved with direct attribute modification
- Minor import dependency ordering resolved

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `POST /api/matters` - Create new matter
- `GET /api/matters` - List all matters with summaries
- `POST /api/matters/{id}/switch` - Switch active matter context
- `GET /api/matters/active` - Get currently active matter

**Next Sprint Prep:**
- Sprint 2 ready to proceed with PDF ingestion pipeline
- Matter management provides solid foundation for document processing
- API client ready for UI integration in later sprints

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
- **UI Framework:** NiceGUI with native desktop mode (`ui.run(native=True)`)
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB with persistent collections per Matter
- **LLM Integration:** Dual provider support (Ollama local + Gemini external)
- **Agent Memory:** Letta integration for persistent, matter-scoped knowledge
- **Background Processing:** AsyncIO-based job queue for responsiveness

### Model Selections
- **Default Generation Model:** `gpt-oss:20b` via Ollama
- **Default Embedding Model:** `nomic-embed-text` via Ollama
- **External Generation:** `gemini-2.5-flash` with user consent

### Data Storage
- **File Layout:** `~/LettaClaims/Matter_<slug>/` with structured subdirectories
- **Vector Storage:** Per-matter Chroma collections under `vectors/chroma/`
- **Agent Persistence:** Letta state under `knowledge/letta_state/`
- **Document Processing:** Separate directories for original, OCR'd, and parsed content

---

# Required for PDF processing and OCR
sudo apt-get install -y \
  ocrmypdf tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng tesseract-ocr-osd \
  poppler-utils
```

### Python Dependencies
```python
# Core application
nicegui>=1.4.0
chromadb>=0.4.0
pymupdf>=1.23.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
uvicorn>=0.23.0
structlog>=23.0.0

  - `nomic-embed-text` (embeddings)
- **Google Gemini API:** Optional external LLM with user consent

---

## Configuration Standards

### Global Configuration (`~/.letta-claim/config.toml`)
```toml
[ui]
framework = "nicegui"
native = true

[llm]
provider = "ollama"
model = "gpt-oss:20b"
temperature = 0.2
max_tokens = 900

[embeddings]
provider = "ollama"
model = "nomic-embed-text"

[ocr]
enabled = true
force_ocr = false
language = "eng"
skip_text = true

[paths]
root = "~/LettaClaims"
```

### Per-Matter Configuration
- Stored as `config.json` in each Matter directory
- Includes matter-specific model preferences
- Tracks embedding model used for consistency

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Target Coverage:** Core business logic functions
- **Key Areas:** Matter management, PDF parsing, vector operations, LLM providers
- **Framework:** pytest with async support

### Integration Testing
- **Workflows:** End-to-end ingestion and RAG pipelines
- **Provider Testing:** Both Ollama and Gemini integration
- **Matter Isolation:** Verify no cross-contamination between matters

### Performance Testing
- **Target:** 200-page spec + 50 pages logs processed within minutes
- **UI Responsiveness:** Main thread never blocks during background jobs
- **Memory Usage:** Stable over long sessions with large document sets

---

## Known Risks & Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** `gpt-oss:20b` may be slow on modest hardware
- **Mitigation:** Configurable model selection, lighter alternatives available

### OCR Quality Risks
- **Risk:** Mixed documents may require manual force-OCR
- **Mitigation:** UI controls for force-OCR retry, skip-text default mode

### Memory Usage Risks
- **Risk:** Large document collections may exhaust memory
- **Mitigation:** Streaming processing, batch operations, resource monitoring

### Native UI Risks
- **Risk:** NiceGUI native mode may fail on some systems
- **Mitigation:** Automatic fallback to browser mode

---

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

Beyond the current PoC scope, potential enhancements include:

### Advanced Analytics
- Timeline visualization from Agent Knowledge
- Contradiction detection between documents
- Clause graph and cross-references

### Retrieval Improvements
- Hybrid retrieval (keyword + dense vectors)
- Multi-modal support (images, tables)
- Improved chunking with structure awareness

### User Experience
- Multi-Matter dashboard with comparative analytics
- Advanced tagging and organization
- Collaboration features for team workflows

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Type Hints:** Full type annotation for all functions and classes
