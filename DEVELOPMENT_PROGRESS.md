- `ui/api_client.py` - Added Matter operation HTTP client methods

**Key Implementation Features:**
- **Matter Creation:** Validates names, generates unique slugs, creates filesystem
- **Matter Listing:** Loads from filesystem with error recovery for invalid configs  
- **Matter Switching:** Thread-safe context switching with proper isolation
- **Filesystem Management:** Creates complete directory structure per specification
- **Configuration:** JSON-based per-matter config with global TOML settings
- **API Integration:** RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- **Validation:** Comprehensive input validation with user-friendly errors

**Testing Results:**
- All core functionality verified through functional test suite
- Matter creation, listing, switching working correctly
- Filesystem structure created properly with all required directories
- Duplicate name handling generates unique slugs (name, name-1, name-2, etc.)
- Configuration persistence working for both global and per-matter settings
- Thread safety verified for concurrent matter switching operations
- Input validation properly rejects invalid data with clear error messages

**Issues Encountered:**
- Pydantic v1/v2 compatibility - migrated all validators to v2 field_validator syntax
- Settings mocking challenges in tests - resolved with direct attribute modification
- Minor import dependency ordering resolved

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `POST /api/matters` - Create new matter
- `GET /api/matters` - List all matters with summaries
- `POST /api/matters/{id}/switch` - Switch active matter context
- `GET /api/matters/active` - Get currently active matter

**Next Sprint Prep:**

- Matter management provides solid foundation for document processing
- API client ready for UI integration in later sprints

### Sprint 3: Vector Database & Embeddings (Completed 2025-08-14, 3h)

**Implementation Summary:**

- Built Ollama embeddings provider with batch processing and error handling
- Created comprehensive metadata preservation for chunk citations
- Added automatic deduplication using MD5 hashes to prevent content duplicates
- Implemented similarity search with configurable k and metadata filtering
- Built collection statistics and management operations (delete, reset)

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- Created batch processing for embeddings (100 chunks per batch)
- Used comprehensive metadata storage for precise citation mapping

**Files Created:**
- `tests/unit/test_vectors.py` - Complete unit test suite (22 tests)
- `tests/integration/test_vector_integration.py` - Integration tests with real Ollama
- `test_sprint3.py` - Sprint verification script

**Files Updated:**
- `app/vectors.py` - Complete VectorStore implementation with ChromaDB
- `app/llm/ollama_provider.py` - Full Ollama embeddings provider
- `app/llm/embeddings.py` - Embedding manager integration
- `requirements.txt` - Added chromadb>=0.4.0

**Key Implementation Features:**
- **Matter Isolation:** Each Matter gets unique ChromaDB collection with zero cross-contamination
- **Embedding Generation:** Async batch processing via Ollama with nomic-embed-text model
- **Vector Search:** Cosine similarity search with metadata filtering and configurable k
- **Chunk Management:** MD5-based deduplication with comprehensive metadata preservation
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks for embedding failures and connection issues
- **Performance:** Efficient batch operations and connection pooling

**Testing Results:**
- All 22 unit tests pass with comprehensive coverage
- Matter isolation verified through multi-collection testing
- Vector search returns properly formatted results with accurate similarity scores
- Metadata filtering works correctly for document and content type filtering
- Large collection handling tested up to 50+ chunks with good performance

**Issues Encountered:**
- Ollama embeddings API endpoint confusion - needed `/api/embed` instead of `/api/embeddings`
- Fixed API response format ({"embeddings": [[...]]} vs {"embedding": [...]})
- ChromaDB collection naming restrictions required sanitization of special characters
- Model name tag handling needed adjustment for "nomic-embed-text:latest" format

**Issues Resolved (2025-08-14 Update):**
- ✅ Ollama embeddings API fixed - using correct `/api/embed` endpoint
- ✅ Both `nomic-embed-text` (768-dim) and `mxbai-embed-large` (1024-dim) models working
- ✅ Real embeddings generating high-quality similarity scores (0.8-0.9+ for relevant matches)
- ✅ End-to-end vector operations tested and verified working

**Acceptance Criteria Status:**
- ✅ Each Matter has isolated Chroma collection
- ✅ Vector search returns results with proper metadata  
- ✅ Similarity scores are meaningful and comparable
- ✅ Large document collections handle efficiently
- ✅ Collection switching works without cross-contamination
- ✅ Embedding model can be changed per Matter
- ✅ Embeddings generated consistently with Ollama

**Next Sprint Prep:**
- Sprint 4 (Basic RAG) can proceed - vector store foundation is solid
- Chunk data model is complete and compatible with ingestion pipeline
- Search functionality ready for RAG query processing

```toml
[ui]
framework = "nicegui"
native = true

[llm]
provider = "ollama"
model = "gpt-oss:20b"
temperature = 0.2
max_tokens = 900

- **Framework:** pytest with async support

### Integration Testing
- **Workflows:** End-to-end ingestion and RAG pipelines
- **Provider Testing:** Both Ollama and Gemini integration
- **Matter Isolation:** Verify no cross-contamination between matters

### Performance Testing
- **Target:** 200-page spec + 50 pages logs processed within minutes
- **UI Responsiveness:** Main thread never blocks during background jobs
- **Memory Usage:** Stable over long sessions with large document sets

---

## Known Risks & Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** `gpt-oss:20b` may be slow on modest hardware
- **Mitigation:** Configurable model selection, lighter alternatives available

### OCR Quality Risks
- **Risk:** Mixed documents may require manual force-OCR
- **Mitigation:** UI controls for force-OCR retry, skip-text default mode

### Memory Usage Risks
- **Risk:** Large document collections may exhaust memory
- **Mitigation:** Streaming processing, batch operations, resource monitoring

### Native UI Risks
- **Risk:** NiceGUI native mode may fail on some systems
- **Mitigation:** Automatic fallback to browser mode
