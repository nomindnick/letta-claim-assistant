### Sprint 0: Project Setup & Foundation (Completed 2025-08-14, 2.5h)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Initialized Git repository with comprehensive .gitignore
- Created Python virtual environment (.venv)
- Pulled required Ollama models (gpt-oss:20b, nomic-embed-text)
- Built complete project directory structure matching specification
- Created requirements.txt with all dependencies and installed successfully
- Implemented foundational modules with proper type hints and documentation
- Created example configuration template and main entry point

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Used structured logging with structlog for better debugging and monitoring
- Implemented settings management with TOML configuration and per-matter JSON configs
- Created provider abstraction layer for LLM and embedding services
- Built comprehensive placeholder modules for all future sprint implementations
- Added proper error handling patterns and async support throughout

**Dependencies Installed:**
- Core: nicegui>=1.4.0, fastapi>=0.100.0, pydantic>=2.0.0
- Vector DB: chromadb>=0.4.0
- PDF Processing: pymupdf>=1.23.0, ocrmypdf>=15.0.0
- LLM Providers: ollama>=0.2.0, google-generativeai>=0.5.0
- Agent Memory: letta>=0.3.0
- Testing: pytest>=7.0.0, pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0

**Project Structure Created:**
```

```

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - all system dependencies were already installed
- All Python packages installed successfully without conflicts
- Ollama models pulled successfully

**Next Sprint Prep:**
- Sprint 1 ready to proceed with Matter management implementation
- All foundational infrastructure in place
- Configuration system operational

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
- **UI Framework:** NiceGUI with native desktop mode (`ui.run(native=True)`)
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB with persistent collections per Matter
- **LLM Integration:** Dual provider support (Ollama local + Gemini external)
- **Agent Memory:** Letta integration for persistent, matter-scoped knowledge
- **Background Processing:** AsyncIO-based job queue for responsiveness

### Model Selections
- **Default Generation Model:** `gpt-oss:20b` via Ollama
- **Default Embedding Model:** `nomic-embed-text` via Ollama
- **External Generation:** `gemini-2.5-flash` with user consent

### Data Storage
- **File Layout:** `~/LettaClaims/Matter_<slug>/` with structured subdirectories
- **Vector Storage:** Per-matter Chroma collections under `vectors/chroma/`
- **Agent Persistence:** Letta state under `knowledge/letta_state/`
- **Document Processing:** Separate directories for original, OCR'd, and parsed content

---

## Dependencies & Requirements

### System Packages (Ubuntu)
```bash
# Required for PDF processing and OCR
sudo apt-get install -y \
  ocrmypdf tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng tesseract-ocr-osd \
  poppler-utils
```

### Python Dependencies
```python
# Core application
nicegui>=1.4.0
chromadb>=0.4.0
pymupdf>=1.23.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
uvicorn>=0.23.0
structlog>=23.0.0

# LLM providers
ollama>=0.2.0
google-genai>=0.5.0

# Agent memory
letta>=0.3.0

# Document processing
ocrmypdf>=15.0.0

# Async utilities
asyncio-mqtt>=0.13.0
```

### External Services
- **Ollama:** Local LLM hosting with models:
  - `gpt-oss:20b` (generation)
  - `nomic-embed-text` (embeddings)
- **Google Gemini API:** Optional external LLM with user consent

---

## Configuration Standards

### Global Configuration (`~/.letta-claim/config.toml`)
```toml
[ui]
framework = "nicegui"
native = true

[llm]
provider = "ollama"
model = "gpt-oss:20b"
temperature = 0.2
max_tokens = 900

[embeddings]
provider = "ollama"
model = "nomic-embed-text"

[ocr]
enabled = true
force_ocr = false
language = "eng"
skip_text = true

[paths]
root = "~/LettaClaims"
```

### Per-Matter Configuration
- Stored as `config.json` in each Matter directory
- Includes matter-specific model preferences
- Tracks embedding model used for consistency

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Target Coverage:** Core business logic functions
- **Key Areas:** Matter management, PDF parsing, vector operations, LLM providers
- **Framework:** pytest with async support

### Integration Testing
- **Workflows:** End-to-end ingestion and RAG pipelines
- **Provider Testing:** Both Ollama and Gemini integration
- **Matter Isolation:** Verify no cross-contamination between matters

### Performance Testing
- **Target:** 200-page spec + 50 pages logs processed within minutes
- **UI Responsiveness:** Main thread never blocks during background jobs
- **Memory Usage:** Stable over long sessions with large document sets

---

## Known Risks & Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** `gpt-oss:20b` may be slow on modest hardware
- **Mitigation:** Configurable model selection, lighter alternatives available

### OCR Quality Risks
- **Risk:** Mixed documents may require manual force-OCR
- **Mitigation:** UI controls for force-OCR retry, skip-text default mode

### Memory Usage Risks
- **Risk:** Large document collections may exhaust memory
- **Mitigation:** Streaming processing, batch operations, resource monitoring

### Native UI Risks
- **Risk:** NiceGUI native mode may fail on some systems
- **Mitigation:** Automatic fallback to browser mode

---

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

Beyond the current PoC scope, potential enhancements include:

### Advanced Analytics
- Timeline visualization from Agent Knowledge
- Contradiction detection between documents
- Clause graph and cross-references

### Retrieval Improvements
- Hybrid retrieval (keyword + dense vectors)
- Multi-modal support (images, tables)
- Improved chunking with structure awareness

### User Experience
- Multi-Matter dashboard with comparative analytics
- Advanced tagging and organization
- Collaboration features for team workflows

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Type Hints:** Full type annotation for all functions and classes
- **Error Handling:** Explicit error types with user-friendly messages
- **Async/Await:** Consistent async patterns for I/O operations
- **Logging:** Structured logging with matter context

### Git Workflow
- **Commit Messages:** `[Sprint X] Brief description of changes`
- **Branching:** Feature branches for each sprint
- **Documentation:** Update this file after each sprint completion

### Testing Requirements
- **Pre-commit:** All tests must pass before sprint completion
- **Integration:** End-to-end tests for user workflows
- **Performance:** Benchmark critical paths
