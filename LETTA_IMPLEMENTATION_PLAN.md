# Letta Agent Memory Enhancement - Revised Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Integrate Letta's persistent agent memory system into the existing construction claims assistant to provide stateful, context-aware interactions that improve over time.

**Approach:** Research-first implementation using modern Letta architecture (server + client), with granular sprints for clear progress tracking and risk mitigation.

**Status:** Research phase completed (Sprint L-R) - Ready for implementation phase.

**Version:** Letta 0.11.3 with letta-client 0.1.258 (verified and tested)

---

## üìö Critical Reference Document

**IMPORTANT:** Before implementing any sprint, consult **`LETTA_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`** for:
- Detailed API examples and code patterns
- Server setup instructions
- Configuration templates
- Troubleshooting guides
- Proven integration patterns

This reference document has been created in Sprint L-R and will be continuously updated with findings.

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:** See `LETTA_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md` for comprehensive implementation guidance.

---

## üîÑ Major Architecture Change

**Previous Assumption:** Use LocalClient for serverless operation (Sprint 5 implementation)
**Current Reality:** LocalClient is deprecated; must use server-based architecture
**New Approach:** Local Letta server (Docker or process) with modern client API
