## Overview

### Current System Architecture
The Letta Claim Assistant is a local-first construction claim analysis application that combines two AI technologies:

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Searches through uploaded PDF documents to find relevant passages for answering questions. Documents are processed through OCR, chunked, embedded as vectors, and stored in a ChromaDB database for semantic search.

2. **Letta Agent Memory**: A stateful AI agent that maintains persistent memory about each matter (case). As users interact with the system, the agent learns and remembers facts, entities, events, and issues. This memory accumulates over time, making the assistant more knowledgeable about the specific case.

Currently, when a user asks a question in the chat:
1. The system searches relevant document chunks using vector similarity (RAG)
2. The Letta agent recalls relevant memories about the matter
3. Both contexts are combined and sent to the LLM to generate an answer
4. The interaction and any extracted facts are stored back into the agent's memory

### Current Limitations
While powerful, the current system has several limitations:
- **Opacity**: Users can only see a basic summary of what's in memory - they don't know what specific facts the agent has learned or might be using
- **No Control**: If the agent memorizes incorrect information, users cannot correct it
- **Mixed Context**: Users cannot choose to query just documents or just memory - it's always both
- **No Direct Memory Interaction**: Users cannot explicitly tell the agent to remember or forget specific information

### What These Features Will Accomplish
This implementation plan adds comprehensive memory management capabilities that will:

1. **Provide Transparency**: Users can see exactly what the agent remembers - every fact, entity, event, and issue stored in memory with full details

2. **Enable Control**: Users can edit incorrect memories, delete irrelevant ones, and manually add important facts that might not be explicitly stated in documents

3. **Offer Flexibility**: Three distinct chat modes allow users to:
   - **RAG-only**: Search only documents (useful for finding specific passages)
   - **Memory-only**: Query only the agent's learned knowledge (faster, focuses on established facts)
   - **Combined**: Current behavior, using both sources

4. **Support Natural Interaction**: Users can manage memory through natural language ("Remember that the deadline is March 15th" or "Forget what I said about the contractor")

5. **Ensure Accuracy**: For legal work, precision is critical. These features ensure the AI assistant's knowledge base is accurate, complete, and under the user's control

Each sprint in this plan incrementally builds these capabilities while maintaining system stability and ensuring existing functionality continues to work perfectly.

## Core Principles
- **Non-breaking**: All changes are additive; existing features continue to work
- **Incremental**: Each sprint delivers usable functionality
- **Testable**: Each sprint includes verification steps
- **Reversible**: Features can be disabled if issues arise

## Implementation Foundation (Already in Place)

### Existing Infrastructure
The codebase already provides strong foundation for these features:

1. **Letta Passages API**: Full CRUD support via `client.agents.passages.*`:
   - `create(agent_id, text)` - Store new memory items
   - `list(agent_id, search, limit)` - Retrieve and search memories
   - `delete(agent_id, passage_id)` - Remove specific memories
   - Each passage has unique `id` for individual management

2. **Memory Storage Pattern**: 
   - Memories stored as JSON-serialized `KnowledgeItem` objects in passage text
   - Existing `KnowledgeItem` model with type, label, date, actors, doc_refs
   - Deduplication and batch operations already implemented

3. **API Infrastructure**:
   - Memory stats endpoint: `/api/matters/{id}/memory/stats`
   - Memory summary endpoint: `/api/matters/{id}/memory/summary`
   - Established patterns for async operations and error handling

4. **UI Components**:
   - `MemoryStatsDashboard` for displaying statistics
   - `MemoryStatusBadge` for operation indicators
   - Existing API client patterns for backend communication

---

## Sprint 1: Memory Items List API (2 hours) âœ… COMPLETED 2025-08-20
**Goal**: Create backend infrastructure to list and retrieve individual memory items

### Tasks:
1. **Add Memory Item Model** (`app/models.py`)
   ```python
   class MemoryItem(BaseModel):
       id: str  # passage.id from Letta
       text: str  # passage.text content
       type: Literal["Entity", "Event", "Issue", "Fact", "Interaction", "Raw"]
       created_at: Optional[datetime]  # passage.created_at if available
       metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Parsed from JSON if text is JSON
       source: Optional[str]  # Extract from metadata if available
       
       @classmethod
       def from_passage(cls, passage) -> 'MemoryItem':
           """Create MemoryItem from Letta passage object."""
           # Parse passage.text as JSON if possible
           # Extract type from parsed data or default to "Raw"
   ```

2. **Add API Endpoints** (`app/api.py`)
   - `GET /api/matters/{id}/memory/items` - List all memory items with pagination
   - `GET /api/matters/{id}/memory/items/{item_id}` - Get specific item
   - Parameters: `limit`, `offset`, `type_filter`, `search_query`

3. **Extend LettaAdapter** (`app/letta_adapter.py`)
   ```python
   async def get_memory_items(
       self, 
       limit: int = 50, 
       offset: int = 0,
       type_filter: Optional[str] = None,
       search_query: Optional[str] = None
   ) -> List[MemoryItem]:
       """Get memory items as structured objects."""
       # Use existing passages.list() API
       passages = await self.client.agents.passages.list(
           agent_id=self.agent_id,
           search=search_query,
           limit=limit
       )
       # Convert passages to MemoryItem objects
       return [MemoryItem.from_passage(p) for p in passages]
   
   async def get_memory_item(self, item_id: str) -> Optional[MemoryItem]:
       """Get specific memory item by ID."""
       # Note: May need to list all and filter since Letta 
       # might not have get-by-id endpoint
   ```

### Verification:
- Test endpoints with curl/Postman
- Verify pagination works
- Check memory isolation between matters

**Goal**: Add backend support for different chat modes

### Tasks:
1. **Define Chat Modes** (`app/models.py`)
   ```python
   class ChatMode(str, Enum):
       RAG_ONLY = "rag"        # Documents only
       MEMORY_ONLY = "memory"  # Agent memory only
       COMBINED = "combined"   # Current behavior (default)
   ```

2. **Update Chat Endpoint** (`app/api.py`)
   - Add `mode` parameter to `ChatRequest` model
   - Keep "combined" as default for backward compatibility

3. **Implement Mode Logic** (`app/rag.py`)
   ```python
   async def generate_answer(
       self, 
       query: str, 
       matter: Matter,
       mode: ChatMode = ChatMode.COMBINED,
       k: int = 8
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       if mode == ChatMode.RAG_ONLY:
           # Skip letta_adapter.recall_knowledge()
           memory_context = []
           memory_items = []
       elif mode == ChatMode.MEMORY_ONLY:
           # Skip vector_store.search()
           doc_chunks = []
           # Use letta_adapter for direct chat
           return await self.letta_adapter.memory_only_chat(query)
       else:  # COMBINED
           # Current behavior - both RAG and memory
   ```

4. **Add Memory-Only Chat Handler** (`app/letta_adapter.py`)
   ```python
   async def memory_only_chat(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Direct interaction with Letta agent without RAG."""
       response = await self.client.agents.send_message(
           agent_id=self.agent_id,
           message=query,
           role="user"
       )
       return {
           "answer": response.messages[-1].text,
           "sources": [],  # No document sources in memory-only mode
           "memory_used": True
       }
   ```

### Verification:
- Test each mode via API
- Ensure default behavior unchanged
- Verify memory-only mode is faster

       query: str,
       mode: str = "combined",  # Add mode parameter
       k: int = 8
   ) -> ChatResponse:
       # Include mode in request
   ```

### Verification:
- Switch between modes and test each
- Verify correct behavior for each mode

## Sprint 7: Natural Language Memory Management (3 hours)
**Goal**: Allow memory management through chat

### Tasks:
1. **Add Memory Command Parser** (`app/memory_commands.py`)
   ```python
   class MemoryCommand:
       action: Literal["remember", "forget", "update", "query"]
       content: str
       confidence: float
   
   def parse_memory_command(text: str) -> Optional[MemoryCommand]:
       """Detect and parse memory management intents."""
       patterns = {
           "remember": r"(remember|note|keep in mind|don't forget)\s+that\s+(.+)",
           "forget": r"(forget|remove|delete)\s+(what I said about|the fact that|that)\s+(.+)",
           "update": r"(update|correct|change)\s+.*memory.*about\s+(.+)",
           "query": r"what do you (remember|know|recall) about\s+(.+)"
       }
   ```

2. **Implement Command Handlers** (`app/api.py`)
   - New endpoint: `/api/matters/{id}/memory/command`
   - Parse natural language
   - Execute appropriate memory operation
   - Return confirmation with what was done

3. **Integration with Chat** (`app/rag.py`)
   ```python
   # Check if query is a memory command
   command = parse_memory_command(query)
   if command:
       if command.action == "remember":
           # Create new memory item
           await letta_adapter.create_memory_item(command.content, "Fact")
           return {"answer": f"I'll remember: {command.content}", ...}
   ```

4. **Add UI Indicators** (`ui/main.py`)
   - Show special icon when memory operation detected
   - Confirmation messages in different color
   - Option to undo last memory operation

### Verification:
- Test various command patterns
- Verify memory updates persist
- Check error handling for ambiguous commands
- Test undo functionality

### Rollback: Disable command detection

## Sprint 8: Memory Search and Analytics (2 hours)
**Goal**: Advanced memory search and insights

### Tasks:
1. **Enhance Search Capabilities** (`app/letta_adapter.py`)
   ```python
   async def search_memories(
       self,
       query: str,
       search_type: Literal["keyword", "semantic", "regex"] = "semantic",
       limit: int = 20
   ) -> List[MemoryItem]:
       """Enhanced memory search with multiple modes."""
       if search_type == "semantic":
           # Use existing passages.list with search param
           passages = await self.client.agents.passages.list(
               agent_id=self.agent_id,
               search=query,
               limit=limit
           )
       elif search_type == "keyword":
           # Get all and filter locally for exact match
           all_passages = await self.client.agents.passages.list(
               agent_id=self.agent_id,
               limit=10000
           )
           # Filter by keyword presence
       elif search_type == "regex":
           # Get all and apply regex pattern
           pass
   ```

2. **Add Analytics Endpoint** (`app/api.py`)

   - Already has `export_memory()` and `import_memory()` methods!
   - Just need to expose via API endpoints

2. **Add API Endpoints** (`app/api.py`)
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/matters/{matter_id}/memory/export")
   async def export_memory(
       matter_id: str,
       format: Literal["json", "csv"] = "json"
   ):
       # Use existing letta_adapter.export_memory()
       
   @app.post("/api/matters/{matter_id}/memory/import")
   async def import_memory(
       matter_id: str,
       file: UploadFile,
       format: Literal["json", "csv"] = "json",
       deduplicate: bool = True
   ):
       # Use existing letta_adapter.import_memory()
   ```

3. **Add UI Controls** (`ui/memory_viewer.py`)

---

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Sprint:
1. Run existing tests to ensure no regression
2. Test new feature in isolation
3. Test integration with existing features
4. Document any issues or limitations

### Integration Testing (After Sprint 6):
- Full workflow: View â†’ Edit â†’ Verify
- Multi-matter memory isolation
- Performance with 1000+ memories
- Concurrent user operations

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Feature Flags
Add to `app/settings.py`:
```python
MEMORY_FEATURES = {
    "view_all": True,      # Sprint 2
    "edit": False,         # Sprint 6
    "chat_modes": False,   # Sprint 4
    "nl_commands": False,  # Sprint 7
}
```

### Gradual Rollout
1. Test with single matter first
2. Enable for power users
3. Full rollout after stability confirmed

### Monitoring
- Log all memory operations
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor error rates
- User feedback collection

---

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Memory-only chat 50% faster than RAG
- **Accuracy**: Users correct <5% of memories
- **Adoption**: 80% of users view memories
- **Reliability**: <0.1% error rate on memory operations

---

## Implementation Summary

### Key Changes from Original Plan
1. **Reordered Sprints**: Edit API (Sprint 3) now comes before Chat Modes (Sprint 5-6) to ensure memory management is available when users switch to memory-only mode
2. **Leverages Existing Code**: Many features (import/export, analytics, search) already have implementations in `LettaAdapter` - just need API exposure
3. **Simplified Update Strategy**: Since Letta doesn't have passages.update(), we use delete+create pattern
4. **Added Implementation Details**: Concrete code examples showing exactly how to integrate with existing codebase

### Technical Insights
1. **Passages ARE Memory Items**: Each Letta passage has a unique ID and can be managed individually
2. **JSON Storage Pattern**: Most memories are stored as JSON-serialized `KnowledgeItem` objects
3. **Existing Infrastructure**: The codebase already has memory stats, summaries, and management methods
4. **UI Foundation**: Memory components already exist and can be extended

### Risk Mitigation Updates
1. **Memory Versioning**: Store deleted passages locally before deletion for rollback capability
2. **Type Detection**: Auto-detect memory type from content structure when possible
3. **Batch Operations**: Use existing batch methods to handle large memory sets efficiently
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all memory operations with timestamps and backup deleted items

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
