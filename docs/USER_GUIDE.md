3. The application creates a folder structure under `~/LettaClaims/`
4. Your new matter becomes active automatically

## Core Concepts

### What is a Matter?

A **Matter** represents a single construction claim or case. Each matter has:
- **Isolated data**: Documents, analysis, and AI memory are completely separate
- **Persistent memory**: The AI remembers facts and context across sessions
- **Document library**: All PDFs and processed content for this case
- **Chat history**: All your questions and the AI's responses

### AI Memory and Learning

The application uses **Letta** for persistent AI memory that makes your assistant smarter about your specific case over time:

#### How Memory Works
- **Entity Recognition**: Automatically identifies parties, people, organizations, projects, amounts, and dates
- **Event Tracking**: Records delays, RFIs, change orders, inspections, and other key events
- **Issue Identification**: Recognizes differing site conditions, design defects, delays, and claims
- **Fact Accumulation**: Key facts and relationships build over time across all interactions
- **Cross-Reference Memory**: Connects information between documents and conversations

#### Visual Memory Indicators
- **Purple Badge**: "Memory Enhanced" appears on responses using stored knowledge
- **Memory Dashboard**: Right panel shows memory item count, connection status, and last sync
- **Agent Health**: Header shows agent status (green = healthy, yellow = issues, red = error)
- **Memory Tooltips**: Hover over enhanced messages to see which memories were used
- **Operation Toasts**: Notifications show when storing or recalling from memory

#### California Construction Specialization
The agent has specialized knowledge for California public works construction:
- **Statutory Recognition**: Identifies California Public Contract Code, Government Code references
- **Agency Awareness**: Recognizes Caltrans, DGS, DSA, counties, school districts, and their requirements
- **Deadline Tracking**: Calculates statutory deadlines with day counts and consequences
- **Compliance Validation**: Checks prevailing wage, DIR compliance, government claim requirements
- **Expert Triggers**: Suggests when specialized analysis (quantum, delay, legal) may be needed

#### Memory Quality and Management
- **Importance Scoring**: More critical information prioritized for recall
- **Deduplication**: Prevents storing duplicate or redundant information
- **Recency Weighting**: Recent conversations weighted more heavily in context
- **Automatic Pruning**: Old or low-importance items can be automatically removed
- **Export/Import**: Memory can be backed up, exported, or transferred between systems

*For detailed memory feature documentation, see the [Letta User Guide](LETTA_USER_GUIDE.md).*

### Local-First Privacy

- All processing happens on your machine by default
- Documents never leave your computer without explicit consent
- External AI services (like Gemini) require one-time consent
- All data stored under `~/LettaClaims/` with user-only access

## Matter Management

### Creating a New Matter

1. **Click "Create Matter"** in the left pane
2. **Enter Matter Name**: Use descriptive names like:
   - "Smith Residence - Water Damage Claim"
