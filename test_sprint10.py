Sprint 10 Verification Script: Job Queue & Background Processing

This script verifies that all Sprint 10 acceptance criteria are met:
- Large PDF uploads don't block UI
- Progress indicators update in real-time  
- Jobs can be cancelled cleanly
- Failed jobs provide clear error messages
- Multiple jobs can run concurrently
- Job status persists across app restarts
