Sprint 5 Acceptance Criteria Verification Script

Tests all acceptance criteria for Letta Agent Integration:
- Each Matter has isolated Letta agent instance
- Agent memory persists between sessions
- Facts from conversations are extracted and stored
- Subsequent queries benefit from prior context
- Follow-up suggestions are contextually relevant
- Memory recall enhances answer quality
- Domain ontology (Entities, Events, Issues, Facts) respected
