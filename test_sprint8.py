- Contract completion deadline is June 30, 2023 [Contract_2023.pdf p.5]
- Weather delays documented on February 15th [Daily_Log_Feb15.pdf p.2]
- Structural specifications require AISC compliance [Spec_Section3.pdf p.10]

## Analysis
The project timeline faces significant challenges due to weather-related delays
and complex structural compliance requirements. The contract clearly specifies
completion by June 30, 2023, but the February weather events have created
scheduling pressures that must be addressed through proper change order procedures.

## Citations
- [Contract_2023.pdf p.5] - Project completion deadline
- [Daily_Log_Feb15.pdf p.2] - Weather delay documentation
- [Spec_Section3.pdf p.10] - Structural compliance requirements

## Suggested Follow-ups
- What weather contingency provisions exist in the contract?
- Should we engage a structural engineer for AISC compliance review?
- How can we accelerate remaining work to meet the deadline?
- What are the liquidated damages implications?"""
